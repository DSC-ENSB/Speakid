Main objectives
---------------
SpeaKid is a cross platform developed for kids aged between 3 and 17 years old suffering from speaking disorder and articulation troubles. It aims to :  

- Acquire better pronunciation of words.
- Improve children’s capacity of assimilation.
- Improve reading and communication skills.  

What is the problem ?
---------------------
This disorder is more common for children aged between 3 and 10 years old and 1 of 12 children are facing it. Its impact does not disappear after their childhood, it actually follows them for the rest of their lives.   

Our solution : SpeaKid
-----------------------
In the face of the lack of attention of the parents towards this kind of phenomena and the expensiveness of a visit to a speech therapist, SpeaKid comes to the rescue by helping to solve these problems through increasing parents’ awareness, helping kids practicing speaking and pronouncing, repeating letters, words, sentences and sounds, and by improving their communication skills and consequently getting them to build their self-esteem and confidence without spending a cent.  

This application also connects doctors with their patients through the SpeaKid website.

Technologies used
------------------
SpeaKid is a cross platform and it required the following technologies :  
- **React Native** for the mobile application side of the solution.
