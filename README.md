What is the problem ?
---------------------
Speech delay is a problem that causes a lot of troubles to kids during a critical period of their lives that may influence their development and their ability to integrate into society, moreover, once they get into school, the situation if not handled correctly could become more problematic and it will develop into an obstacle for them to have access to a quality, safe and inclusive education.
This is not only about a quality education, if we dive deep we will find a health dimension as well, because of the psychological effects a child could suffer from due to his inability to communicate fluently and at the same level as his peers.
This disorder is more common for children aged between 3 and 10 years old and 1 of 12 children are facing it. The impact does not disappear after their childhood, it actually follows them for the rest of their lives.   

Our solution : SpeaKid
-----------------------
In the face of the lack of attention of the parents towards this kind of phenomena and the expensiveness of a visit to a speech therapist, SpeaKid comes to the rescue by helping to solve these problems through increasing parents’ awareness, helping kids practicing speaking and pronouncing, repeating letters, words, sentences and sounds, and by improving their communication skills and consequently getting them to build their self-esteem and confidence without spending a cent.  

This application also connects doctors with their patients through the [SpeaKid website](https://github.com/DSC-ENSB/Speakid-web).
